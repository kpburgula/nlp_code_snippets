Fine-tuning a Question Answering task using pytorch
- Step 1: Prepare the dataset in a pre-defined format: paragraphs, questions, answers
- Step 2: Add start and end indexes of answers
- Step 3: Tokenize the paragraphs, questions: Make train and validation datasets
- Step 4: Tokenize the start and end indexes and add to the train and validation datasets
- Step 5: Prepare the pytorch dataset
- Step 6: Load the pretrained question-answering model
- Step 7: Fine-tuning the question answering module
- Step 8: Save the model
- Step 9: Model Inference
